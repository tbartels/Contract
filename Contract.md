## About this document

I’m really excited that we’re at the stage where we’re signing contracts; it
means that we’re a great fit both professionally and personally (I like working
with nice people). I am very keen to maintain this relationship, and I hope
this document can help us with that. I have tried to remain firm but fair, and
I hope everything within this document seems reasonable.

I have a fairly laid back and informal approach to my work, and I am not a fan
of small print or legalese, so I aim to keep this document as concise and
casual as possible. I hope You agree—and are comfortable—with this tone and
approach.

This document exists to protect the interests of all involved parties, to
outline our responsibilities to one another, and to avoid any confusion or
disappointment during and/or after our time working together.

If anything is unclear please do not hesitate to ask Me any questions. It is
also important to know that amendments and additions can be requested _prior_ to
signing the document. Each project I undertake will have its own individual
nuances and requirements, so I am able and willing to modify this document to
suit the needs of each project.

In summary, {{the_client}} has retained Thomas Bartels to proceed with the
requested services outlined within this document and/or other documents in
accordance with agreed briefs, specifications, costs and deadlines, and agrees
to the terms and conditions set forth in this document.

Now, let’s do great work together!

{{my_address}}

**{{Name}}, ‘The Client’, ‘You’:**

{{client_address}}

## Scope of The Work

The scope of The Work I will be carrying out for You shall be outlined,
understood and agreed in followup correspondence. Emails and other documents
detailing the scope of The Work are supplementary to this document and shall be
referenced and referred to when agreeing and defining the project’s scope.

The work will generally fall under the category of web development, this could
be, but need not be limited to: consultancy time, software development work,
graphic design work, network operations.

I am agreeing to perform {{work_hours}} hours of work per {{timeframe}} period.
I am agreeing to be available to perform **{{work_hours}}** hours of work
**{{timeframe}}** on a retainer basis at a rate of **{{retainer_rate}}**.


### Additional Work

You understand additional work beyond the scope of This Document must be
negotiated separately and will require a separate Agreement. Services requested
by You and provided by Me that do not fall within the scope of This Document
will be billed separately at the full standard hourly rate according to service
category with payment due upon receipt.

## Payment

Being a small business, cash flow is very important to Me. As such, it is asked
that You meet the payment terms outlined below.

### Payment terms

Once a retainer is initiated, an invoice shall be raised for the full amount
of the recurring term. Payment is expected within 15 days of receipt or before
the first day of work for each period, whichever comes first. I will repeat
this process until the retainer is terminated. Any outstanding expenses from
the prior period shall be billed at the same time.

### Retainers

Monthly retainers provide ongoing support at a discounted rate up to the number
of hours set forth in This Document. Retainer fees are required in full in
advance of services. If payment is not received on or before initiating work,
full standard hourly rates will apply for any work performed during that
period, and monies received will be applied accordingly. Any of The Work I
perform beyond the retained number of hours will be billed at the full hourly
rate of {{hourly_rate}}.  Payments rendered are considered fully earned and non
refundable.  Unused hours are not carried over; it is incumbent upon You to
utilize the retained hours each month. I will notify You when the retained
hours are exhausted.

### Expenses

Any expenses (e.g. travel, accommodation, font licenses, stock images, etc.)
shall be charged on top of any charges relating directly to The Work. Payment
is due upon receipt.

## Client Responsibilities

You understand that I am not an employee, and that this will be a
collaborative, professional relationship of equals where mutual professional
respect, courtesy and consideration are expected. Due to the virtual nature of
the relationship, You understand the importance of communication, especially
via email, and agree to respond to questions, requests and communications from
Me in a timely manner. You understand that I am a business with other clients
to serve, and require fair, realistic notice in order to attend to requests and
projects. Poor planning or miscommunications on Your part will not constitute
an emergency for Me. You understand that I may require detailed clarification
of projects in order to meet expectations and provide the best support and
highest quality work.

## Termination

Retainers may be terminated by either You or Me for any reason with one period
advance written notice. This means for a monthly contract, please provide one
month notice, and weekly provide one week notice, etc.

## Deadlines

Deadlines for The Work shall be agreed in separate correspondence, and I shall
do everything within my power to stick to them. In the unfortunate event that
either party cannot meet a deadline, it is important that we remain completely
transparent and honest about any delays or hold ups. Delays can, will, and do
happen, it is how we handle them that matters.

## Copyright and ownership

The nature of open-source, and a lot of The Work I carry out, policing copyright
is quite difficult. Any third-party libraries will remain under their respective
licenses, and it is Your responsibility to ensure that any supplied materials
(stock photography, font files, code, etc.) are correctly licensed.

Once the entire outstanding balance of the project has been paid, all relevant
copyright of The Work that can be assigned to You shall be.

## Disclosure

I am more than happy to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in order to work
on Your project.

I shall explicitly seek Your consent before open sourcing—or writing in any
detail about—any of the code or techniques employed in The Work.

## tl;dr

Let’s just be respectful and mindful of each other at all times, before, during
and after The Work.
