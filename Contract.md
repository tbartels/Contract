## Terms and definitions

	within it.
* **‘The Work’** refers to the project for which this document was actioned.

## About this document

I’m really excited that we’re at the stage where we’re signing contracts; it
means that we’re a great fit both professionally and personally (I like working
with nice people). I am very keen to maintain this relationship, and I hope
this document can help us with that. I have tried to remain firm but fair, and
I hope everything within this document seems reasonable.

I have a fairly laid back and informal approach to my work, and I am not a fan
of small print or legalese, so I aim to keep this document as concise and
casual as possible. I hope You agree—and are comfortable—with this tone and
approach.

This document exists to protect the interests of all involved parties, to
outline our responsibilities to one another, and to avoid any confusion or
disappointment during and/or after our time working together.

If anything is unclear please do not hesitate to ask Me any questions. It is
also important to know that amendments and additions can be requested _prior_ to
signing the document. Each project I undertake will have its own individual
nuances and requirements, so I am able and willing to modify this document to
suit the needs of each project.

In summary, {{theclient}} is contracting Thomas Bartels to complete work
outlined within this document and/or other documents in accordance with agreed
briefs, specifications, costs and deadlines.

Now, let’s do great work together!

## Scope of The Work

The scope of The Work I will be carrying out for You will likely have been
outlined, understood and agreed in previous correspondence. Emails and other
documents detailing the scope of The Work are supplementary to this document and
shall be referenced and referred to when agreeing and defining the project’s
scope.

### Change in scope

There are times when the scope of The Work may change. Ideally we will handle
these as-and-when, and in a pragmatic manner, but any major deviations in scope
may require renegotiation of rates and the termination and renewal of the
contract.

## Deadlines

Deadlines for The Work shall be agreed in separate correspondence, and I shall
do everything within my power to stick to them. In the unfortunate event that
either party cannot meet a deadline, it is important that we remain completely
transparent and honest about any delays or hold ups. Delays can, will, and do
happen, it is how we handle them that matters.

## Copyright and ownership

The nature of open-source, and a lot of The Work I carry out, policing copyright
is quite difficult. Any third-party libraries will remain under their respective
licenses, and it is Your responsibility to ensure that any supplied materials
(stock photography, font files, code, etc.) are correctly licensed.

Once the entire outstanding balance of the project has been paid, all relevant
copyright of The Work that can be assigned to You shall be.

## Disclosure

I am more than happy to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in order to work
on Your project.

I shall explicitly seek Your consent before open sourcing—or writing in any
detail about—any of the code or techniques employed in The Work.

## Alterations, amends and maintenance

Any amends which do not drastically alter the scope of The Work, or that are
intended to bring The Work more in line with project requirements, usually fall
under the agreed scope of The Work and, as such, do not require renegotiation of
costs or this document.

For any changes that do change the scope of The Work, please see the _Change
in scope_ section of this document.

Any bugs, which, unfortunately, cannot be guaranteed against, that are directly
related to The Work, and are discovered within two weeks of the end of The
Work, shall be fixed as a matter of course, and require no renegotiation of
terms. I also apologise in advance if we should ever find ourselves in this
situation.

Maintenance of The Work is not covered by either the project’s costs or this
document unless explicitly agreed. Maintenance work can be specced out and
priced separately to the scope of The Work.

## Payment

Being a small business, cash flow is very important to me. As such, it is asked
that You meet the payment terms outlined below.

### Payment terms

Invoices will be generated at the start of each month after any of The Work has
been performed with a tally of all the uninvoiced hours. Once a project is
deemed complete, an final invoice shall be raised for the remaining balance of
the project cost, along with any other incidental costs (see _Expenses_). All
balances shall be paid within 15 days of being invoiced.

### Expenses

Any expenses (e.g. travel, accommodation, font licenses, stock images, etc.)
shall be charged on top of any charges relating directly to The Work.

## tl;dr

Let’s just be respectful and mindful of each other at all times, before, during
and after The Work.

## Signatures

The undersigned confirm that they have read, understood, and shall adhere to the
terms laid out in this document:
